# Introduction

If you're new to **SassDoc**, take a look at [the official SassDoc documentation](http://sassdoc.com).

**SCSS SassDoc Parser** is a slim parser for the official SassDoc annotations that gives you structured data you can use for whatever you need.

## Getting Started

Get started by first documenting some **[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)** with SassDoc.

If you want an existing project to experiment on you can check out **[Fylgja](https://github.com/fylgja/fylgja)**.

### What you'll need

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** version 14 or above.
- SCSS documented with SassDoc.

## Install

To add SCSS SassDoc parser to your project, run:

```bash
npm install scss-sassdoc-parser
```
